Hi and Welcome to Studi!

We are developing a mobile app designed to foster academic community through gamification. 
This platform will enable students to log their study sessions (location, subject matter, and duration) in a shared social environment. 
By integrating leaderboards and social profiles, the application aims to transform studying from a solitary obligation into a connected and engaging experience.

Get Studi on the App Store today and start leveling up your study sessions!
