App: Studi 
Solution Statement: We are developing a mobile app designed to foster academic community through gamification. This platform will enable students to log their study sessions (location, subject matter, and duration) in a shared social environment. By integrating leaderboards and social profiles, the application aims to transform studying from a solitary obligation into a connected and engaging experience.
